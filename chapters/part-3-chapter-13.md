The private and public sectors have begun to embrace “big data” and analytics to improve productivity and enable innovation. We have documented the tremendous economic potential that can be unlocked by using the increasing volumes and diversity of real-time data (e.g., social media, road traffic flows) to make better decisions in a wide variety of sectors, from healthcare to manufacturing to retail to public administration (Manyika et al., 2011).

公領域與私領域都已經開始擁抱巨量資料與分析，以提高生產力以及實現創新。我們已經證明，從醫療保健、製造業、零售業到公共行政部門等各式各樣的部門間，可以透過提高即時資料的數量與多樣性 (比如社群媒體或是道路交通流量)，來做出更好的決策，而巨大的經濟發展淺力也將被解鎖 (Manyika et al., 2011)。

Open data—governments and other institutions making their data freely available—plays an important role in maximizing the benefits of big data. Open data enables third parties to create innovative products and services using datasets such as transportation data, or data about medical treatments and their outcomes, that are generated in the course of providing public services or conducting research. This is a trend that is both global—in less than two years, the number of national governments that have become members of the Open Government Partnership has increased from a founding eight to more than fifty—and local; state/provincial, and municipal governments, including New York, Chicago, and Boston, have begun to “liberate” their data through open data initiatives.

開放資料---政府與其他機構讓他們的資料可以免費查看或下載--在最大化巨量資料的效益上，扮演了一個很重要的角色。開發資料讓第三方能夠接觸到一些數據庫，比如運輸資料、醫療護理資料，或是其他在公共服務或是研究進行過程中，所產生出來的成果，利用這些資料，來開發創新產品與服務。這是一個全球化的趨勢---兩年之間，參加開放政府聯盟(Open Government Partnership)的政府數量已經從草創期的8個，增加到操過50個---而且地區性、省/州或城市等級的政府，包含紐約、芝加哥、波士頓，都已經開始透過開放資料協議，來"解放"他們的資料。

Some of the key motivations for open data initiatives are to promote transparency of decision-making, create accountability for elected and appointed officials, and spur greater citizen engagement. In addition, however, it is increasingly clear that open data can also enable the creation of economic value beyond the walls of the governments and institutions that share their data. This data can not only be used to help increase the productivity of existing companies and institutions, it also can spur the creation of entrepreneurial businesses and improve the welfare of individual consumers and citizens.

起草開放資料協議的關鍵動機，是為了增加決策的透明度，建立問責制(Accountability)，對被選舉與任命的政務官可追究其責任，並促成更大的公民參與。除此之外，開放資料能夠創造經濟價值，而這價值往往超越分享資料的政府與機構的想像。這些數據不僅能夠用來提高現在公司與機構的生產效率，還可以帶動創業型企業的發展，以及提高消費者與公民的福利。

McKinsey & Company is engaged in ongoing research to identify the potential economic impact of open data, the findings from which will be published in the fall of 2013. In this piece, we would like to share some of our preliminary hypotheses from this work, including examples from our research into open data in healthcare (See “The ‘Big Data’ revolution in healthcare,” McKinsey Center for US Healthcare Reform and Business Technology).

Mckinsey & Company公司正在持續進行研究，找出開放資料潛在的經濟影響，而研究成果將於2013年秋季發表。針對這塊，我們想要分享一些我們從這份研究得到一些初步假設，包括有我們在醫療照護開放資料研究的例子(見"巨量資料"在醫療照護上的革命，McKinsey美國醫療照護改革與商業科技中心)

### Definitions
定義

It’s helpful to first clarify what we mean by open data. We use four criteria to define open data:

* Accessible to all. This is the key criterion—the data becomes accessible outside of the organization that generated or collected it.
* Machine-readable. Data must be useable, which means it must be made available in formats that are easily used in third-party applications.
* Free. Zero or low costs for data access aid openness.
* Unrestricted rights to use. Data that is unencumbered by contractual or other restrictions leads to the maximum potential of innovation.
 
首先，清楚地定義我們所謂的開放資料是有幫助的。我們用四項標準來定義開放資料:

* 對所有人開放。這是最關鍵的標準 - 讓這些資料可以在生成或收集它的機構之外，變得開放、可存取的。
* 可程式化。資料必須是可用的，這意味著它必須提供制式的格式，方便第三方應用程式的使用。
* 免費。幾乎零或很低的資料存取成本，以協助資料的開放性。
* 無限制的使用權。運用無產權負擔或限制的資料，會引發出最大的創新潛力。


However, we also recognize that these are the ideals of “openness” and there is still significant value in making data more widely available, even if its use is not completely unrestricted. For example, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has released some health-care claims data, but only for use by qualified medical researchers, and with strict rules about how the data can be used. Nevertheless, providing this data outside of CMS multiplies the amount of value it can create. Similarly, there is great variation in the degree to which data can be considered machine-readable. Data in proprietary formats is machine-readable, but is less useful than data in open-standard formats, which do not require licenses to use and are not subject to change with format updates decided by a single vendor. And while a strict definition of open data requires zero cost for data access, some institutions have chosen to charge a fee for accessing data, still providing considerable value.

然而，我們也體認到，這些都是“開放”的理想志向，而且讓資料變得更廣泛開放，還有一個重要的價值，即使這些資料的使用上並不是完全不受限制。例如，美國醫療保險和醫療補助服務中心（CMS）雖然公佈了一些醫療理賠資料，但僅提供給合格的醫學研究人員使用，而且在資料的使用上還有嚴格的規定。然而，提供這些資料給CMS以外的單位使用，就可以倍增它原先可以創造的數量。相同地，在認定哪些資料是可程式化上，也存在很大的差異。雖然有專利權的資料格式是可程式化，但是相對於符合開放標準格式的資料，卻顯得比較沒有用，這是因為開放資料不需要任何許可就可以使用，另外，其格式也不因為某一供應商的格式變更而改變。嚴格來說，存取開放資料是不需要付任何成本，儘管有些機構還是對其資料的存取收取一定的費用，但是這些資料也提供相當的價值。

Very closely related to this definition of open data is the concept of “my data,” which involves supplying data about individuals or organizations that has been collected about them. In the United States, the “Blue Button” encourages healthcare providers to give patients access to their health information (see www.bluebuttondata.org). Similarly, the “Green Button” program encourages energy providers to give consumers access to energy usage information such as data collected by smart meters (see www.greenbuttondata.org). In “my data” applications, information is not made accessible to all, but only to the person or organization whose activities generated the data. These users can opt in to make their data available to other service providers (e.g., a service that analyzes energy consumption and suggests ways in which to improve energy efficiency).

非常接近這個開放資料的定義是"我的資料"，這概念涉及到提供個人資料，或那些已經在收集個人資料的組織。在美國，"藍色按鈕"計畫鼓勵醫療照顧提供者，讓病人可以獲取他們的健康資訊 (見www.bluebuttondata.org)。另外，"綠色按鈕"計畫鼓勵能源供應商，讓其客戶可以取得電力使用量資料，如由智慧電表收集到的資料 (見www.greenbuttondata.org)。但是"我的資料"這個APP，並不對所有的人開放所有的資訊，而僅限於個人使用，或是哪些生成這些資料為主的組織。但是APP使用者便可選擇，是否要將他們資料提供給其他的服務供應商 (例如，藉由分析電力使用量，並提供建議來提高能源使用效率的服務)

### Why Now?

It’s also worth considering why the open data movement is gathering momentum. First, the amount and variety of valuable data that is being generated and collected by institutions has exploded: transaction data produced by government, sensor data collected from the physical world, and regulatory data collected from third parties such as transportation carriers or financial institutions. Secondly, the ability to process large, real-time, diverse streams of data has been improving at an exponential rate, thanks to advances in computing power. Today, a smartphone has sufficient processing power to beat a grandmaster at chess.

Equally important, there are institutional forces accelerating the adoption of open data initiatives. Both within and especially outside of government, decision makers are demanding more precise and timely insights, supported by data and experimentation (e.g., running controlled experiments on the web or in the real world to determine how people will actually behave). At the same time, governments are under pressure to become more transparent, while simultaneously doing more with less due to fiscal constraints. The financial pressure also compels governments to look for economic growth and innovation, which could be catalyzed by new businesses based on open data.

Finally, there is a social benefit: open data can democratize information, as more individuals gain access to their own data through my data initiatives, and people with programming skills gain access to more datasets. Individuals can develop applications that use open data, reflecting their interests, rather than relying on data services provided by large organizations.

### How Open Data Creates Economic Value

Our emerging hypothesis is that the effective use of open data can unlock significant amounts of economic value. For example, in US healthcare, we found that more than $300 billion a year in value potentially could be created through the use of more open data, e.g., through the analysis of open data to determine which therapies are both medically effective and cost-efficient. We also recognize that access to data alone does not unlock value. In healthcare, many systemic reforms need to be in place before data-enabled innovations such as large-scale analyses of comparative effectiveness and genetically tailored therapies can achieve their maximum potential. Yet, if reforms are in place, truly transformative changes in the healthcare system can result. We believe similar changes can occur in many other domains.

So what are some of the archetypes for value creation that we discovered? Building on our big data research, we see five common ways in which the use of open data can unlock value.

#### Transparency

In many cases, we find that decisions are made without access to relevant data. Simply providing data to the right decision maker at the right moment can be a huge win. For example, most patients and primary care physicians have limited knowledge about how well different hospitals do in various types of surgery or how much different providers charge for a particular procedure. When such data exists—and is provided in a usable format—the resulting transparency can lead to better decisions. In our study of US healthcare, we estimate that ensuring that patients go to the right care setting (e.g., the one with the best record of outcomes and the best costs) could unlock $50 to $70 billion in annual value.

#### Exposing Variability and Enabling Experimentation

Closely related to transparency is the concept of exposing variability in processes and outcomes, then using experimentation to identify the drivers of that variability. For example, open data can be used to expose the variability in improving student achievement across various schools or school districts. When this information is made transparent, it creates incentives to improve educational outcomes. In addition to simply exposing differences in performance, open data can be used to design and analyze the outcomes of purposeful experimentation to determine which organizational or teaching techniques raise student achievement.

#### Segmenting Populations to Tailor Actions

Open data can also be used to ensure that individuals and organizations receive the products and services that best meet their needs. There is an old saying in marketing that we know that half of marketing spending is wasted, but we don’t know which half. Open data can sometimes help marketers find the additional insights that can make their efforts more effective. For example, a provider of rooftop solar panels could narrow its targeted offers to customers who both have sufficient roof area, and sufficient solar exposure by using aerial imagery and weather data available from public sources.

#### Augmenting and/or Automating Human Decision-Making

Open data can be used to augment the data that is being analyzed to improve or automate decision-making. We know from research in behavioral economics and other fields that human decision-making is often influenced by cognitive biases. Furthermore, our minds are limited in the number of data points we can process. Advanced analytical techniques can help overcome these limitations. For example, researchers only identified the cardiovascular risks of COX-2 inhibitors (a class of anti-inflammatory drugs) after analyzing data on millions of individual doses. In some cases, data can be used to make real-time decisions automatically. For example, by combining data from embedded sensors with open data traffic information, it is possible to create systems that automatically adjust the timing of traffic signals to relieve congestion.

#### Creating New Products, Services and Business Models

Some of the most exciting applications of open data come about when it is used to create new products and services by existing companies, or to create entirely new businesses. For example, in 2012, more than two hundred new applications of open health-care data were submitted to the US Health Data Initiative Forum. One submission, from a startup called Asthmapolis, combines usage data from sensors on asthma medicine inhalers with open environmental data (e.g., pollen counts and data on other allergens) to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with asthma.

### Enablers to Create Economic Value

Successful open data initiatives have many elements and the open data community is beginning to share practices and stories to make success more likely. Based on our ongoing research, we suggest that the following elements are needed for a successful open data initiative.

#### Prioritize Open Data Efforts According to Potential Value

Too often, open data initiatives seem to prioritize releasing data based on the ease of implementation (i.e., making available the data that is easiest to release). We believe the prioritization process should also take value creation potential into account. For instance, datasets collected for regulatory or compliance purposes that enable companies to benchmark their performance against other players in the marketplace (e.g., energy efficiency data, purchasing data) can drive significant increases in economic performance for companies and consumers, even if the release of this data doesn’t directly benefit the public sector agency. Of course, it isn’t possible to predict all of the ways in which open data can be used to create value, so it’s still important to release open data to the large community of potential outside innovators, even if it’s not clear how it will be used. But in the near term, considering potential value creation along with ease of implementation should be part of the prioritization process.

#### Activate a Thriving Ecosystem of Developers to Use Open Data

To a certain extent, open data is a “platform play,” i.e., a foundation on which third parties can build innovative products and services. Tim O’Reilly, founder of O’Reilly Media, has famously described the concept of “Government as a Platform” (O’Reilly, 2011). To have a successful platform, you need to have a thriving ecosystem of contributors that build on your platform. For a successful open data initiative, it is important to activate a thriving ecosystem of developers that will build applications that use open data. This requires activities akin to marketing, including raising awareness of the availability of open data, convincing developers to try using open data (potentially through special offers, perhaps contests), supporting their experience, and even encouraging them to return to use other open data. The “Datapaloozas” that the United States Government has sponsored are an example of activating an ecosystem of developers to consume open data, as they convene developers at common events, celebrating successes and raising the visibility of and excitement around open data.

#### Build the Infrastructure to Manage Data

Clearly, a scalable and reliable data infrastructure has to be put in place. Ideally, an institution’s internal data infrastructure will be designed in such a way that makes it easy to open data to external connections when the decision is made to do so. One guiding principle that can help make this possible is to build internal interfaces as if they were external interfaces. Amazon.com requires all of its internal IT services to have standard application program interfaces. Then, when it wants to expose a new service that it has developed internally to the outside world, the process is relatively straightforward.

#### Identify Channels to Release Data

Thoughtful consideration must also be given to the channels through which open data is distributed. These decisions can greatly affect the uptake and continuing use of open data. Are you releasing data in open data formats that make it easy for third party developers to use? Do you provide appropriate metadata to help guide the users to the data? Do you provide means through which users of the data are alerted automatically when data has been updated?

#### Protect Data That Needs to be Protected

Some institutions have decided to make “open” the default for their data. However, there are often good reasons not to release all of an organization’s data or to restrict openness along one of more of the open data dimensions (e.g., with fees or restrictions on use). Thoughtfully identifying the criteria for such restrictions will be important; they could include safety, security, privacy, liability, intellectual property, and confidentiality.

#### Provide Leadership to the Open Data Community

Last but not least, a successful open data program needs real leadership and a commitment to supporting an open data culture. In some cases, the benefits of releasing data could be outweighed by the perceived risks to managers, who might see an open data initiative as adding more work (e.g., dealing with outside stakeholders), while simultaneously making it more likely that facts in the data might be misrepresented, or even reveal issues about their operations. Leaders will have to set a tone from the top that the overall benefits make an open data initiative worth the investments and risks. Furthermore, leaders will also have to engage with the external community of data consumers, learning to treat them as “data customers,” and being responsive to their concerns and suggestions.

Particularly for smaller municipalities, it can be a challenge to find the resources, both financial as well as human, to invest in open data initiatives. One point  that can help the investment case for open data is that much of the infrastructure for open data, e.g. building internal IT service interfaces as if they were external interfaces, actually improves the efficiency and scalability of the institution itself. Secondly, technology innovations, such as cloud services, are making the level of required investment more manageable. And more generally, taking advantage of external resources, from open source software to innovation fellowships and civic hackathons, can also unlock additional capabilities. Ultimately, institutions will have to determine the relative priority of creating value through open data to support their missions in the context of the other priorities.

Overall, open data can generate value for multiple stakeholders, including governments themselves, established companies, entrepreneurs, and individual citizens. Understanding the scope and scale of this value potential, particularly for stakeholders outside of the organization opening its data, and how to effectively create an ecosystem of data users, will be essential in order to generate this value.
