We live in data rich times. Digital tools, from Facebook to Fitbit, have made more and more thoughts and actions collectable. Thoughts and actions that were once understood as ephemeral and public can now be fixed and privatized. Indeed, many of the artifacts of public life have become sequestered into proprietary and isolated databases, from individual mobility patterns to reflections on current affairs. While this data does not have any obvious function, recent revelations about the National Security Agency monitoring Americans’ metadata points to just how revealing this data can be. Still, the story has created surprisingly little concern because of a general lack of understanding about how metadata can be used. The majority of Americans are comfortable with the federal government accessing their metadata for the purpose of national security (Pew Research/Washington Post, 2013); likewise, they expect that corporations will preserve their privacy by enabling them to control who has access to their personally identifiable data. Both personally identifiable data and metadata are generally seen as passively generated, harmlessly owned and protected by corporations, and “rented” when needed.

我們生活在一個到處充斥著資料的時代。從臉書到Fitbit等數位工具，讓越來越多的想法與行動，變得可以被擷取的 (collectable)。 想法與行動曾經一度被視為是無形且公有化的，但是到現在卻變成有形而且可以被私有化的。事實上，從個人的行動模式，到民眾對現有事務的一些想法，讓原本這些屬於公眾領域的一些事務，現在都被強行地收錄在一些私人且獨立運作的資料庫中。儘管這些資料看起沒有很明顯的用途，但是從最近的美國國家安全署監控美國人的超資料(Meta Data)這件事情可以看出，這樣的資料透露出相當程度的個人隱私。可是這件事情並沒有在美國引起廣泛地討論，這是由於一般民眾對超資料濫用的情況缺乏通盤地了解。另外，絕大多數的美國人並不擔心政府這樣監控作為。他們認為美國聯邦政府是基於國家安全的需要，才會收集她們的超資料。(Pew Research/Washington Post, 2013) 一般民眾也希望私人企業能夠針對一般使用者開放部分權限管理的功能，由使用者來管控誰有權限來取得他們的個人辨識資料，並確保他們隱私權的安全性。一般來說，個人辨識資料以及超資料都被視為是被動地產生、而且可以由私人企業來保存及擁有，甚至在某些的情形下，可以隨時"出租"出去。


Enter the open data movement—a loosely defined effort of technology and policy hackers seeking to reposition data and its uses into the public domain. From health records to geodata, people are creating standards and repositories that facilitate access to, interoperability across, and transformation of datasets, outside of corporate interests. While open data is proving disruptive to a myriad of domains, from music to news, it is particularly powerful in the areas of government and civic life. What we call civic data are any data that inform public life, from the location of fire hydrants and blighted properties to citizen reports of potholes. These are not private data; they are signals transmitted within the public realm that remain publicly accessible.

接下來，我們要進入開放資料運動的時代 --- 一種結合資訊科技與政策駭客，將資料重新定位並應用在公眾領域上的活動。從個人的醫療履歷到地理數據，人們不斷地建立標準與數據庫，讓開發、互通或是轉換資料變得更便利之外，並且可以廣泛地應用這些資料在非營利的目的上。從音樂到新聞，開放資料不斷地被證實，會對很多領域上面產生破壞性的作用。其中以在政府及公民生活領域上，所產生的影響威力更強大。所謂的公民資料是指會傳達公眾生活的任何資料。小到消防栓的地點與空屋的所在地，大到民眾通報的坑洞位置，都屬於這個範疇。這些資料不屬於私人資料:因為是在公眾領域裡面傳送，因此是屬於公眾可以取得的資料。


Over the last several years, governments have pushed to standardize and release large datasets. Technologists have created thousands of tools to aggregate, filter, and facilitate production of this data. Within this sphere of activity, users transition from being renters to co-owners and creators. When they access or contribute data to an open system, they expect not only a service, but also that the aggregate of the data they produce contributes to something larger. Indeed, open civic data is a public asset that can be reused and recombined toward a collective good. The net result is more than just access to standard datasets. The “culture” of open civic data is the reframing of data from a government resource to a publicly owned asset to which every citizen has a right.

在過去數年，政府已經開始推動大型資料標準建立。資訊技術專家已經建立數千個工具，來集合、篩選並提升資料的生產力。在這樣的活動世代中，使用者已經從租借者，轉型成為共同擁有者與建立者。當他們取得或提供資料到開放系統中，他們期待的不只是一種服務，也希望藉由統整他們的資料，可以產生更大的東西。的確，開放的公民資料是公共財的一種，可以透過重新使用與再次組合，成為另外一種可以擷取的商品。這最終結果不僅僅是放入標準的資料庫中。而是這種開放的公民資料的文化，可以重新定義資料從原先是屬於政府的資源，轉化成是一種公眾擁有的財產，而每一個公民都可以主張其權利。


While civic hackers and government employees continue to chip away at the technical and political problems of data accessibility and interoperability, there is a culture of use that is burgeoning in the civic realm that needs to be attended to. New tools enable citizens to access, share, and contribute to civic data repositories. Each time someone uses a tool to help them choose a public school, catch a bus, or report a pothole, they are interacting with and contributing to civic data. When they actively choose to share their own data or access public datasets, they are contributing to a culture of civic data that shapes and refines expectations of how information can and should be used in public life. These simple, yet powerful actions are habits. Civic habits—or any habitual practice of engaging in civic institutions or community life—are the foundation of the culture of open civic data. These actions become the raw material of civic life.


當政客與政府官員不斷地在資料取得與互通性等技術與政策問題上打轉，在公民領域上面卻有一種新的文化蓬勃發展中。最新的工具讓公民可以取得、分享與提供資料到公眾的資料數據庫中。每當某人使用一種新工具來協助公眾事務，比如挑選公立學校，趕上公車或是回報坑洞等，都會對公眾資料互動並做出貢獻。當他們越主動地分享資料或取得公眾資料的同時，他們也會對公民資料文化產生貢獻，如定義且提煉出哪些資料應該且一定會在公共生活中。這些簡單但是效果強大的活動稱之為公民習慣。這些公民習慣---或是任何參予公民組織或社群的例行性活動---都是開放公民資料文化的基礎。而這些行動會演變為公民生活的素材。

Why should the open civic data community be thinking about civic habits? Habits are what ultimately will sustain the culture of open civic data. Without habits, there is no demand for data and no foundation on which to build emergent civic actions. In this essay, we look at one kind of civic technology: Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) systems, or 311 reporting tools. CRM systems cultivate civic habits by making civic actions accessible and repeatable. By looking at three distinct generations of CRM systems, we demonstrate how habits, once established, can be reflected upon so as to generate more and different civic actions.

開發公民資料社群為何需要考慮公民習慣? 因為只有公民習慣能維持開放公民資料文化的活性。如果沒有這些習慣，那麼對於資料就不再有需求，另外，因為缺乏基礎迫切性的公民活動也會無法建立。在本篇短文中，我們將探討一種公民科技: 附有選舉權的關係管理系統(Constituent Relationship Management System; CRM), 或稱為311報表工具。CRM系統藉由可接近且具有重複性的公民行動，來深耕公民習慣。本文將檢視三種不同世代的CRM系統，讓公民習慣，一旦形成後，可以反映並產生更多不同的公民活動。



### Making Civic Habits

建立公民習慣

A habit is a settled or regular tendency, especially one that’s hard to give up. We tend to think of habits as bad: smoking, gambling, etc. “The fact is,” as psychologist William James wrote in 1892, “our virtues are habits as much as our vices. All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits” (James, 1925).

所謂的習慣是一種設定而且週期性的傾向。我們通常將習慣視為不好的東西，比如說抽菸、賭博等。但是William James在1892年提出，美德與惡德都是一種習慣。人的一生，在有限的生命中，都是由無數的習慣所組成 (James, 1925)。

When we talk of civic habits, we are talking about all the practices that form civic life, from bad habits like throwing trash on the street to good habits like picking up another person’s trash; from posting a nasty comment about a neighbor on Facebook to tweeting about traffic. Civic habits are everyday repetitive practices that have a bearing on public life. As James put it, we are “mere bundles of habits, we are stereotyped creatures, imitators and copiers of our past selves” (James, 1925). The social context of a city, therefore, is a mere bundle of habits with tools and systems in place that reinforce or disrupt existing habits. Consider how an antiquated data management system in government can perpetuate bad civic habits as city workers produce incomplete or substandard data. Consider how poor placement of recycling bins can produce bad civic habits as people grow tired of carrying a plastic bottle around and just throw it in the nearest trashcan. Now consider how access to open data can produce good civic habits by providing opportunities for people to visualize and augment the world around them so as to make better, more informed decisions.

當我們談論公民習慣時，我們必須考量所有可以形成公民生活的活動，包含隨地亂丟垃圾壞習慣，與主動撿起路上垃圾的好習慣；或是在臉書上張貼對鄰居有暇想的貼文，到在托特上面抱怨交通。公民習慣是一種每天重複性的活動，而且對於公共生活有承載的作用。如James指出，我們是由一堆習慣所組成，千篇一律地模仿與複製我們過去生活一切的生物( James, 1925)。因此，一個城市的社交內容便僅僅是一堆習慣，並搭配不同的替代工具與系統，來強化或中斷現有習慣。比方說，城市工作者因為使用政府過時的資料管理系統，而產生不完整或不標準的資料，那麼原有的壞習慣便會持續下去。還有，由於政府缺乏對於資源回收箱擺設地點的規劃，而導致人們漸漸地習慣把寶特瓶放到離他們最近的垃圾桶，這樣下去，就會形成不好的公民習慣。另外，取得開放資料的方式也會養成良好的公民習慣，因為人民有機會去想像與強化他們所身處的這個世界，並讓她們能夠做更好、更有知識的決策。

Habits are even more valuable than the sum of their parts. They are the building blocks that are necessary if a citizen is to move beyond individual or serial actions to be more aware and able to reflect about his or her role in civic life. The philosopher John Dewey argued that all learning is premised on habitual actions (Dewey, 2011). According to Dewey, it is only when something becomes habitual that one has the opportunity to reflect on it—like learning an instrument or a language. Learning happens when one becomes aware of the systems in which actions are taken. For example, when a child is learning to play the piano, she begins immediately to make music by pressing keys in no apparent order. She does not actually learn to play the piano until she understands that strings of notes compose melodies and groupings of notes compose chords. If she never has the opportunity to place her habits within larger systems, if there is no internal or external structure to her learning, there is a danger of getting stuck in a non-reflective habit loop that merely continues the same action without the possibility of growth. When people have the opportunity to place their habits into systems, habits become productive of other habits and emerging systems.

習慣是比習慣的組成更有價值。一個公民如果想要超越單獨或是一系列的行動，來讓自己更了解以及更能反映他/她在公民生活的角色，那麼習慣是最必要的基石。哲學家John Dewey認為，所有的學習都是習慣性行動的前提(Dewey, 2011)。當學習成果有機會反映在系統上，如學習一種樂器或語言，這樣的學習漸漸地會形成一種習慣性的行動。當一個人更了解行動所在的系統，那麼學習就會跟著產生。比方說，當一個小孩剛接觸鋼琴時，她不需要任何學習，就可以在琴鍵上隨便彈奏出聲音，但是這樣的聲音卻讓人聽起來很不舒服。唯有當她開始學習音符、旋律與和旋等知識後，她才能彈奏出悅耳且美妙的音樂。如果她從來沒有在更大型的系統表現出她的習慣，而且缺乏結構式學習，那麼她可能會因此困在無回饋的迴圈中，持續性地重複相同的行動，而無法成長。一旦人們有機會在系統中表現出他們的習慣，這些習慣會讓其他的習慣的產生更有效率，並對新興系統的研發更有生產力。

Civic habits are all the actions citizens take that interface with public institutions or communities, from voting to reporting to littering to checking in on an elderly neighbor. Civic habits are produced through formal systems and processes. They are also generated informally by ad hoc groups and networks. What are often missing from this “mass of habits” are opportunities for reflection. It should come as no surprise that government often fails at producing processes and systems that both cultivate habits and provide opportunities to reflect. It is too often the case that government makes productive habit formation difficult because barriers to participation are simply too high. But as the culture of open civic data intersects with government processes, there are examples of government fulfilling its role as a systems designer for civic habits.

公民習慣則是公民們跟公共組織或社群互動的所有行動，比如投票、檢舉亂丟垃圾以及探訪年老鄰居等。公民習慣的養成有兩種方式；藉由正規的系統與流程產生，以及透過臨時群體與網路非正式性地衍生出來。但是要有大量的習慣養成，最主要的關鍵還是在有無回饋機制的機會。政府在這方面做得相當地差，常常無法提供好的系統與流程，來養成習慣並提供平台讓這些習慣有所表現。主要的問題還是在政府參予公民習慣養成過程中，遇到的障礙太多、門檻太高。但是藉由與公開公民資料文化的互動，政府部門的角色就可以順利地轉變成公民習慣的系統設計者。

One such example is the rapidly growing field of Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) systems. All big cities in the United States have some mechanism for citizens to report problems, from potholes to downed limbs or graffiti. These systems have undergone a series of iterations, from traditional hotlines (CRM 1.0) to mobile applications and interactive web pages (CRM 2.0) to mobile and web tools that frame interaction within a reflective context (CRM 3.0) (see Figure 1). As we will explain, these systems are progressively influenced by the culture of open data. The move from 1.0 to 3.0 reflects an emerging context where citizens can contextualize habits within clearly demarcated systems so as to introduce new actions, new habits, and a new understanding of civic life.

### Civic Habits and CRM

公民習慣與CRM系統

While CRM systems were originally developed as part of the New Public Management approach that emphasized a customer-centered or citizen-centered government, they are also deeply connected to the open data movement as both suppliers of civic data and as tools by which to display and publicize civic data. Over the last several years, governments and non-profits have developed a variety of tools. While they all collect, organize, and publicize civic habits to some degree, these tools’ ability to foster good civic habits differ dramatically. Early CRM enabled habits, but did little to encourage them. While the next major developments in CRM facilitated the development and recognition of habits, it was not designed for reflection as a necessary or even important component of habitual action. Currently, as CRM tools are being improved and added to, there are isolated examples of designing for better, reflective civic habits that deserve attention and continuation.

CRM系統原先屬於新公共管理方法論的一部分，強調政府應以顧客為中心、以市民為主體。而現在的CRM系統則跟開放資料運動很緊密地結合在一起，因為兩者都是公民資料的提供者，也都是用來呈現且公有化公民資料的工具。過去幾年，政府與非營利組織發展出很多種的工具。大多數的工具可以收集、組織與公有化公民資料，但是在養成公民習慣上卻差異很大。早期的CRM系統允許，但沒有很積極地鼓勵習慣的養成。而下個世代CRM系統最主要的發展，則在開發與判別習慣方面上，提供很多便利的功能。但是它的設計卻缺乏反射機制，以至於習慣性行動無法形成。但是隨著CRM系統不斷改良，目前有很多獨立設計，可以產生更好、更能反射公民習慣的CRM系統。這些系統都值得我們關注與追蹤其發展。


Although it has certainly impacted governments’ approach to data, the open data movement’s first major impacts on CRM systems did little to move the public toward a culture of open data. Before mobile applications ruled the reporting scene, phone-based hotlines (and later web portals) provided insight into civic habits. Active in over 130 cities, traditional phone-based reporting systems are still in widespread use and largely considered to be success stories in terms of efficiency. CRM 1.0 tools enable citizens to provide information that is relevant to a series of reporting categories. Citizens enter information into a set of forms or relay this information to an operator. While these tools allow citizens to file reports efficiently and effectively, they lack interactivity. They are good at enabling transactions: citizens need something fixed, they report it, and the government responds. Even when reports concern public issues—a broken sidewalk or graffiti on a wall—the hotline system frames the habit as a private action: citizens get their particular, specific needs met; they are not prompted to view their needs as one of many or as an issue shared with others within a community.

儘管開放資料運動已經改變政府在資料處理的方式，但是它在CRM系統的影響，對於社會大眾接受開放資料，效果即有限。在手機應用程式還沒有普遍之前，以電話為主(或是之後的網頁介面)的熱線通報系統，對於公民習慣產生很多重要的觀點。熱線通報系統目前已經還在130城市廣泛地使用，就效率而言，這套系統是一個相當成功的模式。CRM 1.0工具可以讓市民回報訊息時，在訊息上加上類別資訊。只要在通報時，在通報單上直接選取通報類別，或是由客服人員手動回填。這些工具雖然可以提升市民回報流程效率並且強化訊息的有效性，但是缺乏互動性。這些工作可以落實交流: 市民需要某樣東西，就回報給系統，然後由政府做出相對應的動作。甚至當回報內容是有關公眾的議題，比如說壞掉的人行道或是牆上的塗鴉等，熱線通報系統還是把這樣的訊息當作個人的訊息回報。所以政府只是滿足市民特定的需求，而市民們無法類似社群內討論議題般，共享其他人的需求。

Whether phone-based or online, the open data movement has directly impacted these tools. The Open311 movement, for example, has encouraged cities to follow many protocols to ensure that their data is made public and also able to seamlessly integrate with other cities’ data and future applications. As a result, a significant portion of the data collected in these systems is made available to the public. Still, they are disconnected from the actions themselves. While they contribute to a valuable store of data, they do not feedback to the user to cultivate reflection on habits and understand how those habits fit into the landscape of the community and the city.

不管是以電話或是網路為基礎的系統，開放資料運動已經開始衝擊這些工具的發展。比方說，Open311運動促使每個城市都能遵守相同的協定，去開放他們的資料，並且將彼此的資料與應用程式無縫地整合起來。因此，這些工具所有收集到的資料，其中有很大一部分是可以開放給大眾取用。但是這些資料依然無法跟行動連接起來。雖然他們有助於資料的儲存，但是他們無法提供任何回饋給使用者，來培育反射習慣機制，以及了解如何將這些習慣應用在社群與城市上。

Mobile reporting apps and web tools do more than merely replicate the experience offered by older technologies. As CRM systems go mobile and take better advantage of the web, non-governmental groups have developed tools that can be used across cities. An example of a system created by a non-government group is SeeClickFix. Governments themselves have developed tools, such as NYC311, Chicago Works, and Citizens Connect (Boston). Building upon the existing open data movement, now over 25,000 cities are using SeeClickFix and thirty-two cities are developing apps that support Open311’s set of open data standards. These systems display data to more citizens, but more importantly, they allow citizens to see their own data in relation to larger community datasets. Within these apps, data is immediately available and ready at hand, and it serves as the foundation for subsequent actions.

手機回報APP與其他網路工具，不僅僅能取代舊有的技術，還能提供其他新功能。隨著CRM系統逐步轉入行動化以及對於網路應用愈趨成熟，非政府組織已經開發出不少可跨城市使用的工具，SeeClickFix是其中一例。目前由政府研發的工具，有NYC311, Chicago Work以及Citizen Connect(波士頓)等。而SeeClickFix則是建立在這些的開放資料工具之上由非政府組織開發完成的工具。現在已經有超過兩萬五千個城市都在使用SeeClickFix，其中三分之二的城市，也正在研發符合於Open311開發資料標準的應用程式。這些工具除了可以將資料提供給更多的市民外，最重要的，還是讓市民們了解到，他們的這些資料在更大型的社群資料庫的對應關係。這些應用程式，除了可以市民們隨時且隨手取得資料外，還可以當作後續動作的基礎。 


In Boston’s Citizens Connect, we can see how CRM 2.0 does more to civic actions than categorize and publicize them; it makes them immediately visible to citizens and connects them to the creation of public knowledge. Rather than simply being confronted by a form to fill out, users can look at other reports—deciding to view them according to most recent or by a specific geographical location. SeeClickFix allows users to see the profiles of “neighbors” using the system in a specific area. These maps are the traces of collective civic habits, and through them, users can visualize their own habits, as well as those of the community as a whole. This visualization of civic habits marks the first step toward reflection.

我們可以從波士頓市民連結工具上，看出CRM 2.0系統對公民活動能夠提供更多的功能，而不只是分類與公佈這些活動。波士頓市民工具，除了即時發佈活動內容，還可將不同的活動連結起來，並且創造公眾知識。使用者不單只是填寫表單，反之，他們可以看到最新的或是屬於某一個地方的報告，並且自行決定要不要去檢視這些文件。SeeClickFix工具則可以讓使用者，檢視某個特定地點的鄰近區域概況圖。這些地圖有可擷取公民習慣軌跡圖，並且透過這些圖資，使用者可以看到他們本身的習慣，以及整個社群的習慣都可以顯示在地圖上。圖形化公民習慣則是反射機制的第一步驟。


These tools are widely considered to be successful. Existing apps are scaling themselves to function seamlessly across multiple cities, as is the case with Massachusetts’ Commonwealth Connect, an iteration of Boston’s Citizens Connect, and the amount of participation via these apps is significant—SeeClickFix hit its 500,000th report in May of 2013. Geolocation and easy camera access in these apps make reporting easier, reports clearer, and as a result, government responsiveness and efficiency of service better. These tools are well positioned to turn individual actions into habitual practice and to expand the influence of such practices to populations not currently predisposed to them.

Enabling reflection, however, has proven to be quite difficult. While these tools can present an individual’s civic habits within a larger public context, they do not always succeed at generating motivation for users to pay attention to that context. A survey of 217 of Boston’s Citizens Connect users (a response rate of about forty-one percent, sampled from all currently active users) has shown that users are unlikely to engage with the map-based visualization of recent reports or even bother to look at other citizens’ reports. Thirty-eight percent of users report that they have never used the mobile app to look at other users’ reports, and forty-one percent report they use this feature “a minority of the time.” With only slightly over nine percent of users reporting they “always” make use of this feature, it is clear that although possibilities for reflection are designed into the tool, the typical use context does not yet motivate these actions.

There are exceptional cases of citizens working together to solve problems before the city can get to them—fixing a damaged mural or overturning a neighbor’s garbage can to free a possibly-dead possum—but these are not the norm. CRM tools have not fully taken advantage of the emerging culture of open civic data to cultivate reflection on civic habits. They still tend to default to the mere facilitation of habitual practice, but as more and more cities commit to using these tools or seek to develop their own, non-reflective habits should not be enough. These tools have the potential to cultivate reflection, where taking individual action leads to actionable public understanding.

CRM tools should be iterated, redesigned, and expanded to create environments that not only allow for reflection upon one’s role in civic life, but also actually necessitate it. Some good examples include SeeClickFix’s asking and answering feature and Civic Hero, a gamified version of reporting. While these examples are promising, they may not go far enough—how one interacts with CRM should be fundamentally reconfigured for reflection. In other words, when a user picks up Citizens Connect to report a pothole, that impulse should be immediately framed within a larger social context.

Built as an API that connects to multiple existing tools—Boston’s Citizens Connect and Commonwealth Connect, SeeClickFix, and Foursquare—StreetCred is one such example. It is designed to improve civic habits and encourage reflection upon these habits at multiple points in the interaction. In StreetCred, players are prompted to take specific actions using already-existing tools, such as Citizens Connect, and are rewarded with badges, which contribute to larger campaigns and real-life rewards. Actions, badges, and campaigns all contribute to a social reputation system that lets players see their participation within the context of community data.

The significance of this intervention is three-fold. First, StreetCred contextualizes one-off moments of participation within greater civic goals and highlights big picture needs of a community or city. Fundamentally, the idea of campaigns is meant to order discrete transactions into legible accomplishments with clear objectives. This practice attempts to interrupt and supplement existing habits with moments of reflection by encouraging actions that citizens have not taken, but are related to either citizens’ own interests, or major issues within the community. Second, through location-based interactions, StreetCred makes players aware of how their actions contribute to overall participation at a local, community, and city level. Campaigns are often related to local geographic areas, and users’ actions and standing are always displayed within the map-based interfaces that highlight an individual’s actions within their local community. As opposed to systems where the act of reporting can be a private interaction with a city, StreetCred allows users to take civic action alongside and in comparison to other citizens. By constructing APIs that connect data from a variety of aggregators, be they privately or publicly owned, StreetCred highlights the fact that open data is not limited to government-run programs.

### Conclusion

Civic life is a mass of habits. By enabling moments of civic participation to be collected in ways that are accessible, interoperable, and visible, the open data movement has provided citizens with a way to easily understand these habits and opened up a bounty of new opportunities to simply and flexibly cultivate them. As more and more data is collected and collectable, it is government’s responsibility to create and/or support the systems in which habits are formed and reflected upon.

As CRM systems and civic apps undergo further development and iteration, we must move beyond simply designing to make civic actions easy and sustainable. Instead, design choices that encourage reflective civic habits and collaborative and communal participation ought to be the norm. Not only can tools be designed to improve and deepen the civic experience, but their iterations can also set the stage for the development of a more robust culture of open data that extends beyond the civic realm.
